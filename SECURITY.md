## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, we encourage you to report it responsibly.

Your cooperation in disclosing vulnerabilities helps us maintain the security and integrity of the project.

We will acknowledge your report as soon as possible and work closely with you to validate and understand the vulnerability. Once the vulnerability is confirmed and mitigated, we will release a security update to the supported versions of the project.

## Responsible Disclosure

We request that you follow responsible disclosure practices and refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had sufficient time to address it. This ensures that our users are protected from potential exploits.

Thank you for your support in making this project more secure. Your efforts help us improve the safety and reliability of our software for everyone.
